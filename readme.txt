By default Linux Mint XFCE opens programs on the monitor they were last present.
This doesn't work for some programs like Mozilla Thunderbird.
I liked the way the i3 window manager enabled one to set the position of programs.
In order to move a maximised no title-bar Thunderbird it is necessary to unmaximise it temporarily.

Requires wmctrl
